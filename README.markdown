   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configure Email**:
   Update `face_recognition_live.py` with your email settings:
   ```python
   app.config['MAIL_SERVER'] = 'smtp.gmail.com'
   app.config['MAIL_PORT'] = 587
   app.config['MAIL_USE_TLS'] = True
